  Ruse began in 2018 with the vision of redefining vegan food. Instead of buying
  pre-packaged

  vegan meats and pre-made sauces we decided to make everything in house. From
  our plant-

  based lamb to our hibiscus tacos, everything is thoughtfully made and
  meticulously spiced. The result is well priced food, made with whole
  ingredients without the adulteration of big

  corporations. Our mission is to continue expanding both our reach and our menu
  while staying

  true to grassroot ideals. Make sure to check out our calendar to find out
  where we will be next!
